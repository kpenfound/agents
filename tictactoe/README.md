# Tic Tac Toe Agent!

## Setup

1. Run the game server `dagger shell -c "server | up"`
2. Run the web client `dagger shell -c "play | up"
3. Navigate to `http://localhost/` and start a game
4. Run the agent with `dagger shell -c "ai {your workstation IP} {game ID}"`

FIXME: This needs the IP instead of the service itself until a bug is fixed.
