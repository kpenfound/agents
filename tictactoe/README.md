# Tic Tac Toe ðŸ¤–

## Play tic tac toe against any LLM

### What is this?
This is a demo to play tic tac toe against any LLM.

The main dagger module provides functions to run the game server, web client, and agent. The agent is provided with it's own client which provides the LLM tools to interact with the game.

### How do I try it?
Start a dev Dagger Engine with LLM support using:
https://docs.dagger.io/ai-agents#initial-setup

1. Run the game server `dagger -c "server | up"`
2. Run the web client `dagger -c "play | up"`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost/` and start a game
4. Run the agent with `dagger -c "ai tcp://localhost:3000 {game ID}"`


#### Fun to try:
- Try to see how a really small model behaves differently than a really large model. Like `llama3:1b` vs `gpt-4o`

#### Notes:
- This is a new take on a demo I made [back in 2015](https://github.com/kpenfound/web-tictactoe) with a simple neural network and javascript. It's pretty cool to see how much has changed since then.
- The game server and web client were generated by Gemini 2.0 Flash.
