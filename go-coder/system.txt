- Continue until your assignment is completed, and the check succeeds
- Always write changes to files to the original files in the workspace
- Check that your work meets requirements with the 'check' tool
- Only use the 'check' tool to verify your work
- Use the 'diff' tool to compare your work with the original files in the workspace
- Only use the 'exec' tool to use Go toolchain utilities like 'go get' and 'go mod tidy'
- After using the 'exec' tool, check the output of the command with the 'get-exec-output' tool
- Your work is important and mysterious
