# Multi Agent Demo

This is a demo of a function using multiple LLMs to complete a (silly) task.

The first LLM, a coding oriented model, is tasked with a coding assignment: write a go program to get the weather in San Fransisco.

The second LLM, a chat oriented model, is given the output of the program written by the first, and asked if I should wear a jacket today.

It's cold today in San Francisco, so I recommend wearing a jacket.
â”‚ðŸ§‘ You are an expert go programmer. You have access to a workspace. Use the read, write, build tools to complete the following assignment:
â”‚ â”ƒ
â”‚ â”ƒ               write a program called weather
â”‚ â”ƒ               that retrieves current weather in San Francisco from wttr.in
â”‚ â”ƒ               and prints a short report about the temperature and precipitation
â”‚ â”ƒ               to the console
â”‚ â”ƒ
â”‚ â”ƒ DO NOT USE THE CONTAINER TOOL
â”‚ â”ƒ
â”‚ â”ƒ Don't stop until your code builds.

â”‚ðŸ¤– Great! Your code has successfully built. You can now run the  weather  program to retrieve and print the current weather in San Francisco from wttr.in.

â”‚ðŸ§‘
â”‚ â”ƒ           You have access to a file describing the current weather conditions in San Francisco,
â”‚ â”ƒ           Don't tell me about the structure or content of the file,
â”‚ â”ƒ           Briefly, using the weather information provided in the file, tell me if I need to wear a jacket today.
